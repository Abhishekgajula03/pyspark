What is PySpark?
PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open-source, distributed computing system designed for big data processing and analytics. PySpark allows you to leverage the power of Spark using Python.

Key Features of PySpark:
Distributed Computing: Handles large datasets by distributing computation across a cluster of machines.
Big Data: Designed to process massive datasets that cannot fit into memory.
In-Memory Processing: Performs faster computations by keeping data in memory rather than relying heavily on disk.
Multiple Libraries: Offers modules like Spark SQL, MLlib (machine learning), GraphX (graph processing), and Spark Streaming.
Scalable: Can run on clusters of thousands of nodes.
What is Pandas?
Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It works best for handling smaller datasets that fit into memory.

When to Use PySpark vs. Pandas
Use PySpark When:
Working with large datasets that don't fit into memory.
Needing distributed computing to scale across clusters.
Using big data tools like Hadoop or HDFS.
Requiring fault tolerance for production systems.
Use Pandas When:
Working with small to moderately large datasets that fit into memory.
Performing data cleaning, transformation, or EDA.
Developing small-scale data applications or prototypes.
Needing an easy-to-use library with a lower learning curve.
Practical Example
Pandas Code Example:
python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob'], 'Age': [25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Add a new column
df['Age in 5 Years'] = df['Age'] + 5
print(df)
PySpark Code Example:
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Example").getOrCreate()

# Create a DataFrame
data = [('Alice', 25), ('Bob', 30)]
columns = ['Name', 'Age']
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Add a new column
df = df.withColumn('Age in 5 Years', df['Age'] + 5)
df.show()
Conclusion
Use Pandas for small datasets and tasks on a single machine.
Use PySpark for big data and distributed computing needs.
